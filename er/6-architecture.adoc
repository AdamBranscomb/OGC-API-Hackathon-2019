== Architecture

The focus of the hackathon was on development of the OGC API - Common, the OGC API - Features, OGC API – Processes, the OGC API – Coverages and the OGC API – Map Tiles standards. Implementations of these specifications were deployed in the Hackathon infrastructure in order to build a solution with the architecture shown in <<img_architecture>>. As shown on the illustration, the architecture adopted a multi-tier approach that included one or more implementations of each OGC API specification deployed on the wider Internet (e.g. in participants' own Cloud environments), as well as some implementations deployed in the Ordnance Survey's Cloud which is hosted on Microsoft Azure.

The OGC API - Common specification documents the set of common practices and shared requirements that have emerged from the development of Resource Oriented Architectures and Web APIs within the OGC. The specification serves as a common foundation upon which all OGC APIs will be built. The OGC API - Processes specification defines how a client application can request the execution of a process, how the inputs to that process can be provided, and how the output from the process is handled. The OGC API - Map Tiles specification defines an OGC standard for a Web Map Tile API that can serve map tiles of spatially referenced data using tile images with predefined content, extent, and resolution. The OGC API - Coverages specification defines a Web API for accessing coverages that are modelled according to the http://docs.opengeospatial.org/is/09-146r6/09-146r6.html[Coverage Implementation Schema (CIS) 1.1]. The hackathon also sought to maintain consistency between the aforementioned specifications and the OGC API - Features specification. The OGC API - Features specification offers the capability to create, modify and query geospatial feature data on the Web.


=== Service Implementations

==== 52°North JavaPS

The 52°North JavaPS product is an open source implementation of both the Web Processing Service (WPS) standard and the OGC API - Processes specification. JavaPS enables the deployment of geospatial processes on the Web in a way that conforms to OGC standards. The software is built using the Java programming language and is supported by a developer toolchain that includes Maven and Git/Github. The software features a pluggable architecture for processes and data encodings that is based on the 52°North https://wiki.52north.org/SensorWeb/Iceland[Iceland] project which represents a generic Java framework for OGC Web Services. By virtue of being based on the Iceland project, JavaPS provides components that are associated with processing geospatial data, for example request objects, response objects, decoders, encoders, parsers.

==== pygeoapi

pygeoapi is a Python server implementation of the emerging OGC API specifications. Early versions of this software implemented the OGC API - Features specification (formerly WFS 3.0). Recent versions of the software have included support for both the OGC API - Features and the OGC API - Processes specifications. Support for these specifications makes it possible publish feature data and geospatial processes. As the name suggests the software is built using the Python programming language and is supported by a developer toolchain that includes Docker and Git/Github.

=== Client Implementations

==== OpenSphere OGC API Plugin

This plugin extends OpenSphere with OGC API Features (aka WFS3) support. An instance of the client application, with the GeoSolutions GeoServer and pygeoapi master demo server pre-configured was deployed at http://frozen-lime.surge.sh/ . Other services can be added - click on the "Add Data" button in the top left, then on Manage Servers. The client application runs from a web browser.
The OpenSphere OGC API Plugin was configured to support up to 10,000 features if a server is configured according to the OGC API - Features specification. There are plans to include support for OGC APIs for map tiles and processes in the future.

==== Hexagon LuciadLightspeed

LuciadLightspeed provides a foundation for advanced geospatial analytics applications. It allows users to create high performance command & control and location intelligence applications with clean design implementation and rapid application development. A desktop client application was implemented using LuciadLightspeed and configured to interface services implementing the OGC API - Map Tiles specification.

==== Solenix WPS Demo Client

The Solenix WPS Demo client is an adaptation of the OGC Testbed 14 client, accounting for some of the changes introduced with the OGC API - Processing.

The client application runs from a web browser.

==== OWSLib OGC API - Features Client

OWSLib is a longstanding Python package providing Pythonic access to OGC services. Recent work allows for interacting with OGC API - Features services. Designed as a reusable component/library, this allows projects in the Python ecosystem to work with OGC API - Features in Python as part of their workflows. The nature of OGC API - Features greatly lowers the implementation barrier.
