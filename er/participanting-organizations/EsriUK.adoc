==== Motivation to Participate

Evolution of the OGC specifications to a modern, developer-friendly API is essential. 

==== Implemented Solution

To date we have not implemented any of the new draft OGC API standards in our released software. We have been working on various R&D prototypes of server and client. 

==== Proposed Alternatives

TBA

==== Experiences with OGC API Specifications

Esri has been involved in the OGC since its inception, and have widely implemented many other OGC standards in both server and client software.

==== Other Impressions & Recommendations
